UnityDrive
========
Unifying cloud storage, one account at a time.

Everyone has run into a time when they needed a file from one of their various
cloud accounts, and then been reduced to the drudgery of signing into multiple
accounts spread across several webpages.  It's not uncommon to have many
different cloud storage accounts in this day and age, further adding to the disarray
of personal storage.

We're here to change that.

UnityDrive not only allows you to sign into multiple instances of your
cloud storage accounts (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box), but it allows
you to maintain simultaneous connections to several accounts in each of these
services side by side.

UnityDrive then allows you to work with the files from all your cloud storage
accounts in one unified aggregate view. In the future we hope to allow each user
to have their own cloud instance of the application (spun up in Heroku), able to
be accessed anywhere. This isn't merely convenient, it ensures that the user's
data never passes through our hands.

Without the hassle and worry of many scattered cloud accounts, you can rest at
ease knowing exactly where and how to access your data when you need it most.

Unify your storage.  Unify your life.  __Unify your destiny__.
